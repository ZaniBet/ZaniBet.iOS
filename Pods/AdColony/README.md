Our advertising SDK is trusted by the world’s top gaming and non-gaming publishers, delivering them the highest monetization opportunities from brand and performance advertisers. AdColony’s SDK can monetize a wide range of ad formats including in-stream/pre-roll, out-stream/interstitial and V4VC™, a secure system for rewarding users of your app with virtual currency upon the completion of video and playable ads.

## Release Notes

### 3.3.5
* Removed requirement for the camera and calendar permissions. However, with these permissions enabled, you may be able to receive higher paying ads.

Here is the link to the [release notes](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for all the previous SDK versions and please check out the 3.3 SDK [integration tips](https://www.adcolony.com/blog/2018/02/22/reaching-new-heights-sdk-3-3/).

## Getting Started
To get started, here is the link to [iOS SDK integration documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki).

**Note:**

* Tested and verified on iOS 11
* Compiles on iOS 6; however, video ads will only show on iOS 8 and above.
* Not backwards compatible with any AdColony 2.0 integrations due to major API changes.

## Upgrading

#### SDK 2.X
Please note that updating from our 2.x SDK is not a drag and drop update, but rather includes breaking API and process changes. In order to take advantage of the 3.x SDK, a complete re-integration is necessary. Please review our [documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki) to get a better idea on what changes will be necessary in your app.

For detailed information about the AdColony SDK, see our [iOS SDK documentation](https://github.com/AdColony/AdColony-iOS-SDK-3/wiki).

#### SDK 3.X
Updating from our previous SDK 3.x versions requires no code changes, just drag and drop the framework into your Xcode project. If you are using Cocoapods, sync with the latest by running `pod update`.
